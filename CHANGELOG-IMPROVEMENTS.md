- ⚠️ Warnings (no file to save, etc.)

### Features:
- Theme-aware styling (matches current theme)
- 3-second duration
- Bottom-right positioning
- Smooth animations
- Custom icons for success/error states

---

## 📁 Sidebar Enhancements

### 1. **Active File Highlighting**
- Currently opened file is clearly highlighted with:
  - Background color
  - Accent color border (3px left border)
  - File name in accent color
  - Bold font weight

### 2. **Unsaved Changes Indicator**
- Pulsing dot indicator appears next to filename
- Only shows when file has unsaved changes
- Smooth pulse animation (2s cycle)
- Uses accent color for visibility

### 3. **Single File Support**
- Files opened without a folder now appear in sidebar
- Sidebar title changes to "Open Files" when showing standalone files
- Better context for users working with single files

### Implementation Details:
- Added `currentFile` and `hasUnsavedChanges` props to Sidebar

## 🖼️ Image Loading Support

### Overview:
Markdown files can now display local images securely through Tauri's asset protocol.

### Key Components:

#### 1. **Asset Protocol Configuration** (`tauri.conf.json`)
```json
"security": {
  "assetProtocol": {
    "enable": true,
    "scope": [
      "$HOME/**",
      "$DOCUMENT/**",
      "$DOWNLOAD/**",
      "$PICTURE/**",
      "$DESKTOP/**"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 2. **Dynamic File System Scope** (Rust backend)
- `grant_file_scope()` command added
- Automatically grants read access when opening files/folders
- Recursive access to parent directory and subdirectories

#### 3. **Automatic Path Conversion** (Frontend)
- New utility: `imagePathConverter.js`
- Converts markdown image paths to Tauri asset URLs
- Supports:
  - Relative paths (`./image.png`, `../assets/logo.svg`)
  - Absolute paths (`/home/user/Pictures/photo.png`)
  - Already converted URLs (no re-conversion)

### Supported Image Formats:
- PNG (.png)
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- GIF (.gif)
- SVG (.svg)
- WebP (.webp)

### How It Works:
1. User opens a markdown file with images
2. App grants file system scope for the file's directory
3. Image paths are converted to `asset://` protocol
4. MDEditor renders markdown with converted paths
5. Images display securely

### Files Modified/Created:
- ✨ `src/utils/imagePathConverter.js` - New utility
- 📝 `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Asset protocol config
- 📝 `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` - Permissions
- 📝 `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Added `protocol-asset` feature
- 📝 `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Added `grant_file_scope()` command
- 📝 `src/App.jsx` - Integrated image conversion
- 📝 `src/components/MainEditor.jsx` - Display content support

---

## 📝 State Management Improvements

### New State Variables:
- `originalContent` - Tracks initial file content for comparison
- `hasUnsavedChanges` - Boolean flag for unsaved status
- `displayContent` - Processed content with converted image paths

### Automatic Tracking:
- Changes detected via `useEffect` hook
- Real-time updates to sidebar indicators
- Proper state reset after save operations

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### CSS Enhancements:
- Rounded corners on file tree items
- Smooth transitions for all hover states
- Pulse animation for unsaved indicator
- Better spacing and margins
- Active file stands out with accent theming

### User Experience:
- Immediate visual feedback for all actions
- Clear indication of current file
- Obvious unsaved changes warning
- Consistent theming across all new features

---

## 🔒 Security

### File System Access:
- Sandboxed access through Tauri's security model
- Scope limited to opened directories only
- Automatic scope management (no manual configuration)
- Asset protocol prevents unauthorized access

### Image Loading:
- Only images in opened folder/parent directory accessible
- Secure conversion to asset protocol
- No direct file system exposure to frontend

---
