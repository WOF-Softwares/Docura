## üéØ Sending Tips

### **Best Practices:**

1. **Keep it short** - DHH gets hundreds of emails
2. **Lead with value** - "Omarchy integration" in subject line
3. **Show, don't tell** - Include working links
4. **No pressure** - "I don't expect a response"
5. **Gratitude** - Thank him for his work

### **Timing:**

- **Weekday mornings** (US Central Time) are best
- Avoid Mondays (busy) and Fridays (weekend mode)
- Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-11am Central is ideal

### **Follow-up:**

- If he responds: Be gracious, answer questions
- If he doesn't: That's totally fine! He's busy
- Don't send a follow-up email
- Maybe tweet about it and tag him (less intrusive)

## üöÄ Alternative: Tweet First

Sometimes a tweet is less intrusive than email:

```
@dhh Built Omarchy integration into Docura! üé®

When Omarchy sync is on, manual theme changes are blocked.
Not user-hostile‚Äîphilosophically consistent.

Just like Rails: opinionated, respects convention, it just works.

Built this with deep respect for your work. üôè
```

**Pros of tweeting:**
- Public (others see it too!)
- Less intrusive than email
- Easy to retweet/share
- DHH is active on Twitter

**Pros of emailing:**
- Direct communication
- More personal
- Can include more detail
- Private conversation

**Why not both?** 
- Email first (with package link)
- Tweet a few days later (if no response)
