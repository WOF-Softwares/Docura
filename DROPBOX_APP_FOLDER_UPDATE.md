# 🔐 Dropbox App Folder Access - Security Update

## Overview

Docura's Dropbox integration now uses **App Folder access** instead of full Dropbox access. This is a significant security and privacy improvement!

## ✅ What Changed

### Before (Full Access)
- ❌ Could access entire Dropbox
- ❌ Broad permissions
- ❌ Users might hesitate to grant access
- ❌ Security concerns

### After (App Folder) ✨
- ✅ Only accesses `/Apps/Docura/` folder
- ✅ Limited, scoped permissions
- ✅ Users trust it more
- ✅ Better privacy and security
- ✅ Cleaner organization

## 🎯 User Benefits

### 1. Enhanced Security
- **Isolated Access**: Docura can ONLY access its own app folder
- **No Snooping**: Cannot see or access any other files in Dropbox
- **Clear Boundaries**: Easy to understand what's being synced

### 2. Better Privacy
- **Limited Scope**: Only specific folder is accessible
- **Transparent**: Users can see exactly what's synced in `/Apps/Docura/`
- **Easy Revocation**: Just delete the app folder to remove all synced data

### 3. Improved UX
- **Clear Organization**: All Docura files in one place
- **No Clutter**: Doesn't mix with existing Dropbox structure
- **Visual Clarity**: OAuth dialog shows app folder path
- **Trust**: Users are more comfortable granting limited permissions

## 📁 How It Works

### Sync Flow

1. **User Connects Dropbox**
   - OAuth dialog appears
   - Shows that files go to `/Apps/Docura/`
   - Browser opens to authorize
   - User grants app folder access only

2. **User Adds Sync Folder**
   - Selects local folder (e.g., `~/Documents/Notes`)
   - Chooses subfolder name (e.g., "My Notes")
   - Files sync to `/Apps/Docura/My Notes/`

3. **Syncing**
   - All files stay within `/Apps/Docura/` folder
   - Clear hierarchy and organization
   - Easy to browse in Dropbox

### Example Structure

```
Dropbox/
├── Photos/                    # ❌ Docura cannot access
├── Documents/                 # ❌ Docura cannot access
└── Apps/
    └── Docura/               # ✅ Docura's app folder
        ├── Work Notes/       # User's synced folders
        ├── Personal/
        └── Projects/
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Code Changes

1. **OAuth Scope** (`dropbox_sync.rs`):
   ```rust
   // Added explicit scopes for app folder access
   scope=files.content.write files.content.read
   ```

2. **UI Updates**:
   - `OAuthDialog.jsx`: Shows app folder path with info box
   - `SettingsDialog.jsx`: Clarifies files go to `/Apps/Docura/`

3. **Documentation**:
   - Updated `DROPBOX_SYNC_INTEGRATION.md` with security section
   - Created `DROPBOX_APP_SETUP.md` for developer setup
   - User guide already mentions app folder paths

### OAuth URL (Updated)

**New URL format:**
```
https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize
  ?client_id={CLIENT_ID}
  &response_type=code
  &redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}
  &token_access_type=offline
  &scope=files.content.write files.content.read
```

## 📝 Setup Requirements

### For Developers

When creating a Dropbox app, you MUST:

1. **Choose "App folder" access type** (not "Full Dropbox")
2. Enable permissions:
   - `files.content.write`
   - `files.content.read`
3. Set redirect URI: `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`

See `docs/sync/DROPBOX_APP_SETUP.md` for complete setup guide.

### For Users

No changes needed! The experience is the same, just more secure:
- Connect Dropbox via Settings → Cloud Sync
- Add folders to sync
- Files automatically sync to `/Apps/Docura/`

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### OAuth Dialog

**Before:**
- Generic OAuth flow
- No clear indication of access scope
- Used `prompt()` for code entry

**After:**
- Beautiful step-by-step dialog
- Clear indication: "Files will be synced to `/Apps/Docura/` folder"
- Auto-opens browser
- Copy URL button with visual feedback
- Professional UI matching Docura's theme

### Settings Dialog

Added info box showing:
> 📁 Files will be synced to `/Apps/Docura/` folder in your Dropbox

## 🔒 Security Benefits Summary

| Aspect | Full Access | App Folder ✅ |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Scope** | Entire Dropbox | `/Apps/Docura/` only |
| **User Files** | Can access all | Cannot access |
| **Privacy** | Broad access | Limited access |
| **Trust** | Users hesitant | Users comfortable |
| **Revocation** | Complex | Simple (delete folder) |
| **Audit** | Hard to track | Easy to see |
| **Data Isolation** | Mixed | Separated |

## 📚 Updated Documentation

1. **DROPBOX_SYNC_INTEGRATION.md**
   - Added "Security & Privacy" section
   - Explains app folder benefits

2. **docs/sync/DROPBOX_APP_SETUP.md** (NEW)
   - Complete developer setup guide
   - App folder configuration steps
   - Security best practices

3. **docs/sync/USER_GUIDE.md**
   - Already shows app folder paths in examples
   - Clear sync folder structure

## ✨ User Experience

### What Users See

1. **Connection Dialog:**
   ```
   Step 2: Authorize Docura
   
   📁 Your files will be synced to /Apps/Docura/ folder
      in your Dropbox for security and privacy
   ```

2. **Settings:**
   ```
   ☁️ Dropbox Sync
   
   📁 Files will be synced to /Apps/Docura/ folder in your Dropbox

   ```

## 🚀 Migration Notes

### For Existing Users (If Any)

If you were using full access before:
1. Disconnect from Dropbox in settings
2. Reconnect (will use app folder now)
3. Re-add sync folders
4. Files will sync to `/Apps/Docura/` going forward

### For New Users

Just connect and go! Everything is set up for app folder access by default.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This update makes Docura's Dropbox integration:
- **More Secure**: Limited access scope
- **More Private**: User files protected
- **More Trustworthy**: Clear, transparent access
- **Better UX**: Clean organization and clear communication

The app folder approach is the **gold standard** for Dropbox integrations, and users will appreciate the security-conscious design! 🔐✨
