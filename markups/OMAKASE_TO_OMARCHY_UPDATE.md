# 🎯 Omakase → Omarchy Rebranding

## Why This Change?

You're absolutely right! 🎯

### The Confusion:

**Omakase (おまかせ)** = Japanese word meaning "I'll leave it up to you"
- Used in sushi restaurants
- Original inspiration for DHH's project

**Omarchy** = DHH's actual project name for Arch Linux!
- Omakase + Arch = Omarchy
- The correct name for the curated Arch Linux environment

### The Problem:

We were calling it "Omakase" everywhere, which is:
- ❌ Technically incorrect (that's just the Japanese word)
- ❌ Confusing for users
- ❌ Not the actual project name

## 🎯 What Stays the Same (Backend/Internal)

**Important:** The internal code still uses "omakase" naming:
- ✅ `omakaseSync.js` (internal utility)
- ✅ `isOmakaseEnvironment()` (function name)
- ✅ `omakaseAvailable` (state variable)
- ✅ `omakaseSyncEnabled` (state variable)

### Why?

1. **Code consistency** - Don't want to break things
2. **Variable names** - Already established
3. **User doesn't see** - These are internal
4. **Inspired by Omakase** - The philosophy is still "omakase" (leave it to the chef)

**User-facing = Omarchy**  
**Code-internal = omakase (as concept)**

## 🌐 URL Changes

### Before:
- ❌ `https://omakase.app` (incorrect/generic)

### After:
- ✅ `https://omakub.org` (DHH's actual website for Arch setup)

## 💎 The Philosophy Stays the Same

Even though we changed "Omakase" → "Omarchy", the philosophy is unchanged:

- 🍣 **Omakase philosophy** - "I'll leave it up to you" (trust the chef)
- 🎨 **Omarchy implementation** - DHH's curated Arch environment
- 💎 **Docura respect** - When Omarchy controls, we don't override

**The spirit of "omakase" (trust) lives on in "Omarchy" (the product)!**
