# Omakase Integration - Implementation Summary

## 🎨 Feature Complete! Ready for DHH

Docura now has full Omakase integration with the philosophy you requested: **When synced with Omakase, theme control stays with Omakase!**

---

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Omakase Detection**
- Automatically detects if `omakase-theme-current` command exists
- Shows detection status in Settings dialog
- Gracefully handles non-Omakase environments

### 2. **Theme Synchronization**
- Maps all 12 Omakase themes to Docura themes:
  - Dracula → Dracula Dark ✨ (your favorite!)
  - Catppuccin → Cappuccino Dark
  - Nord → Nord Dark
  - And 9 more!
- Auto-sync every 30 seconds (configurable)
- Manual sync via toolbar button
- Toast notifications on theme changes

### 3. **Settings Dialog**
- New Settings menu item (Menu → Settings)
- Shows Omakase status (detected/not detected)
- Displays current Omakase theme & font
- Shows mapped Docura theme
- Toggle for auto-sync
- Manual "Sync Now" button

### 4. **Menu System**
- Unified menu in toolbar (replaces scattered buttons)
- Organized sections: File, Export, View, Settings
- Keyboard shortcuts displayed
- Clean, professional look

### 5. **Theme Change Prevention** 🔒
**This is the key feature you requested!**

When Omakase sync is enabled:
- ❌ Random theme button → Shows error: "Please disable Omakase sync first"
- ❌ Theme selector → Shows warning banner + disables theme cards
- ❌ Apply button → Disabled
- ✅ User must go to Settings → Uncheck sync → Then can change themes

**This respects the Omakase philosophy:** When you choose Omakase control, Docura respects that choice!

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Omakase User (Auto-Sync Enabled)
1. Opens Docura → Omakase detected! 🎨
2. Goes to Settings → Enables "Auto-sync with Omakase"
3. Docura syncs immediately
4. Every 30 seconds, checks Omakase theme
5. Changes theme in terminal → Docura follows!
6. Tries to click Random → ❌ Error: "Disable sync first"
7. Opens Theme Selector → ⚠️ Warning banner + disabled themes
8. User knows: "Omakase is in control!"

### Scenario 2: Omakase User (Manual Control)
1. Opens Docura → Omakase detected
2. Keeps sync **disabled** in Settings
3. Uses Docura theme controls freely
4. Can click "🔄 Omakase" button anytime to sync once
5. Full manual control

### Scenario 3: Non-Omakase User
1. Opens Docura → No Omakase detected
2. Settings shows: "Omakase not detected"
3. No sync button in toolbar
4. App works normally
5. Zero friction!

## 📝 Notes for You

### Testing:
The dev server is running! Open Docura and test:
1. Menu → Settings
2. Check Omakase status
3. Try the prevention features!

### If You Don't Have Omakase:
You'll see "Omakase not detected" - that's correct!
The app still works perfectly.

### Commands Docura Uses:
```bash
# Detection
which omakase-theme-current

# Get theme
omakase-theme-current
# Output: dracula

# Get font
omakase-font-current  
# Output: CaskaydiaMono Nerd Font Mono
```
