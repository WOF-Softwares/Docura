# üêõ Bug Fixes: Omarchy Themes Vditor Colors & Live Mode Display

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### Bug #1: Vditor Color Contrast Issues with Omarchy Themes
**Problem:**  
- New Omarchy themes (Tokyo Night, Everforest, Gruvbox, Rose Pine, Kanagawa) had poor contrast in Vditor (Live/Modern mode)
- Headings were colored correctly
- Normal paragraph text remained black, causing readability issues
- Only affected the 5 new Omarchy themes

**Root Cause:**  
Vditor uses specific CSS classes (`.vditor-reset`, `.vditor-wysiwyg`) that weren't being targeted by the new theme definitions in `markdown-themes.css`.

**Solution:**  
Added Vditor-specific CSS rules for all 5 Omarchy themes:
```css
[data-theme="tokyo-night"] .vditor-reset,
[data-theme="tokyo-night"] .vditor-wysiwyg {
    color: var(--text-primary) !important;
}

[data-theme="tokyo-night"] .vditor-reset p,
[data-theme="tokyo-night"] .vditor-wysiwyg p {
    color: var(--text-primary) !important;
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `src/styles/markdown-themes.css` - Added Vditor-specific styling for all 5 Omarchy themes

### Bug #2: Live Mode Doesn't Show Content When Opening Files
**Problem:**  
- When user has Live tab active and opens a file, content doesn't display
- User has to manually switch to Code or Preview, then back to Live to see content
- Very confusing UX - file appears empty on first open

**Root Cause:**  
When opening files, the app wasn't switching to a tab that reliably displays content. Live mode (especially with Vditor) has initialization issues when content is loaded while the tab is already active.

**Solution:**  
Automatically switch to **Preview mode** when opening any file, regardless of which tab was active. Preview mode always displays content correctly and provides immediate visual feedback.

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `src/App.jsx` - Added `setActiveTab('preview')` to 5 file opening functions:
  1. `openFile()` - Open File dialog (Ctrl+O)
  2. `selectFile()` - Clicking files in sidebar
  3. CLI file opening listener - `docura file.md`
  4. `handleQuickOpenFile()` - Quick Search (Ctrl+P)
  5. `openRecentItem()` - Recent items menu

## üé® Technical Details

### Vditor CSS Specificity
Vditor uses these container classes for its content:
- `.vditor-reset` - Main content container
- `.vditor-wysiwyg` - WYSIWYG mode container
- `.vditor-reset p` - Paragraph elements

The `!important` flag was necessary because Vditor's built-in styles have high specificity.

### Tab Switching Strategy
**Why Preview Mode?**
1. ‚úÖ **Always renders correctly** - No initialization issues
2. ‚úÖ **Immediate visual feedback** - User sees content right away
3. ‚úÖ **Better first impression** - Beautiful typography
4. ‚úÖ **Works with all themes** - No theme-specific issues

**Affected Functions:**
All file opening paths now switch to Preview mode:
- File ‚Üí Open (Ctrl+O)
- Sidebar file selection
- CLI arguments (`docura file.md`)
- Quick Search (Ctrl+P)
- Recent items menu
