   - When Omarchy controls themes ‚Üí Docura respects that
   - No overrides, no fighting the configuration
   - "It just works"

2. **Active Sync**
   - Real-time theme detection every 30 seconds
   - Automatic theme switching when Omarchy theme changes
   - Seamless integration

3. **Exact Matching**
   - Not approximations, EXACT theme implementations
   - Matching Omarchy's color palettes precisely
   - Professional attention to detail

4. **User Choice**
   - Enable/disable Omarchy sync in Settings
   - Clear warnings when sync is active
   - Transparent behavior
