## 🙏 The Message

**To DHH:**

You've spent decades showing us that software with strong opinions is good software. That respecting convention over configuration makes better tools. That simple, opinionated design wins.

We listened.

Docura's Omakase integration isn't just about syncing themes. It's about respecting your philosophy. When a user enables Omakase sync, they're saying "I trust this system." And we honor that trust by not allowing overrides.

**Just like Rails respects convention, Docura respects Omakase.**

Thank you for inspiring a generation of developers to build better tools. 🙏

**Built with respect, shipped with pride!** 🎉🎨

Ready to share with the world! 🚀
