## 💪 Why Docura Wins

### Technical Superiority:

**Typora:**
```css
/* Their "focus mode" is basically: */
.not-focused {
    opacity: 0.3; /* Just dim it! */
}
```

**Docura:**
```javascript
// Our focus mode is a full production:
const overlay = document.createElement('div')
overlay.style.cssText = `
    position: fixed;
    top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);
    pointer-events: none;
    z-index: 998;
    transition: clip-path 0.2s ease;
`

// Dynamic clip-path cutout that follows cursor!
overlay.style.clipPath = `polygon(
    0 0, 100% 0, 100% 100%, 0 100%, 
    0 ${top}px, ${left}px ${top}px,
    ${left}px ${bottom}px, ${right}px ${bottom}px,
    ${right}px ${top}px, 0 ${top}px
)`

// Plus: mouse tracking, cursor tracking, keyboard tracking!
```
