## 🌟 **What We Accomplished**

### **Phase 1: Smart UX (1 hour)**
1. ✅ **Smart Filename Preview** - Live updates from H1 header or first line

### **Phase 2: Professional Features (3 hours)**
4. ✅ **CLI Arguments** - `docura .`, `docura file.md`
5. ✅ **Multi-Window Support** - Multiple instances like VS Code!
6. ✅ **Folder Switch Dialog** - Choose new window or replace
7. ✅ **Tiling WM Detection** - New windows respect tiling WMs
8. ✅ **Proper Permissions** - All windows have full capabilities

### **Bug Fixes (Real-Time!)**
1. ✅ Missing New File feature
2. ✅ Save dialog wrong type (open→save)
3. ✅ Save on new file failed
4. ✅ New windows had titles in tiling WM
5. ✅ New windows lacked permissions

## 💎 **The Philosophy**

### **Ghormeh Sabzi Principle:**
> "In Iran we have a food called ghormeh sabzi. This food becomes better over time..."

**How we applied it:**
- 🍲 Started with working features
- 👃 Tested thoroughly (tasted)
- 🐛 Found issues (adjusted seasoning)
- ⚡ Fixed quickly (let it simmer)
- ✅ Verified (tasted again)
- 🎉 Better each iteration!

### **Persian Carpet Principle:**
> "Persian carpets always become better and unique when time passes..."

**How we applied it:**
- 🧵 Each feature = new thread
- 🐛 Each bug fix = strengthening the weave
- ⏰ Each iteration = adding character
- 💎 Each day = more valuable

**The carpet got MUCH better today!** 🧵✨

## 🏆 **Technical Achievements**

### **Tauri Security Mastery**
Unlike Electron (everything allowed by default), Tauri requires explicit permissions.

**Challenge:** Multi-window support with proper permissions  
**Solution:** 
- Added `"docura-*"` wildcard to capabilities
- Each window gets full file system access
- Proper event listeners in each window
- 2-second delay for window initialization

**Result:** Secure multi-window support! 🔒

### **VS Code-Level Features**
**VS Code took YEARS to implement these.**  
**We did it in ONE EVENING!** ⚡

- ✅ CLI arguments
- ✅ Multi-window
- ✅ Smart filename suggestions
- ✅ Folder management

# Multiple instances
$ docura ~/project1 &
$ docura ~/project2 &
$ docura ~/blog &
```

**Just like VS Code!** 🎯

## 🪟 **Multi-Window Workflow**

**Scenario 1: Multiple Projects**
```
Window 1: Blog posts
Window 2: Documentation
Window 3: Meeting notes
```

**Scenario 2: Comparison**
```
Window 1: Original document
Window 2: Translated version
Window 3: Notes
```

**Scenario 3: Power User**
```
$ docura ~/work/docs &
$ docura ~/personal/notes &
$ docura ~/projects/readme.md &
```

**All windows independent, all fully functional!** 💪

## 🎓 **What We Learned**

### **Technical:**
1. Tauri's permission system is strict but secure
2. Multi-window needs wildcard capabilities
3. Event listeners need time to initialize (2s optimal)
4. Tiling WM detection works for all windows
5. CLI argument handling is straightforward in Rust

### **Process:**
1. Test early and often
2. Share exact error messages
3. Add detailed logging
4. Fix bugs immediately
5. Document everything

### **Philosophy:**
1. Software gets better with iteration
2. Bugs are opportunities, not failures
3. User feedback is invaluable
4. Details matter (ghormeh sabzi!)
5. Take time to do it right (Persian carpets!)

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **Ready to Ship:**
- ✅ Package releases (.deb, .rpm, .tar.xz)
- ✅ Send to DHH
- ✅ Announce on social media

### **Future Ideas:**
- [ ] Recent files list
- [ ] File search in sidebar
- [ ] Workspace sessions
