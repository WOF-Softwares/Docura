Subject: Built Omarchy Integration Into Docura - Respecting Your Philosophy

---

Hi David,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to share something I built that I think you'll appreciate—especially as an Omarchy user.

I built Docura, an open-source markdown editor for Arch Linux. What makes it special is native Omarchy integration that follows your philosophy of opinionated software.

WHAT MAKES THE OMARCHY INTEGRATION DIFFERENT

Most apps add "theme import" and let users override everything. That misses the point.

Docura respects Omarchy's control:
• Auto-detects Omarchy environment (omarchy-theme-current)
• Syncs themes automatically (Dracula, Nord, Catppuccin, etc.)
• Uses your Omarchy font in the editor
• When sync is enabled, manual theme changes are BLOCKED

That last point is intentional. Just like Rails respects convention over configuration—when you choose Omarchy to control your themes, Docura honors that choice. No fighting, no half-measures.

THE PHILOSOPHY IN CODE

When you enable Omarchy sync and try to manually change themes:
→ "Please disable Omarchy sync first to manually change themes"

It's not user-hostile—it's philosophically consistent. You taught us that opinionated software is good software.

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS

• 96% smaller than Typora (12 MB vs 326 MB)
• Three editing modes: Code, Live (WYSIWYG), Preview
• Native Arch support with tiling WM detection
• Built with Tauri (Rust) + React
• Apache 2.0 licensed

EASY INSTALLATION

For Arch Linux with Omarchy:

  # Download package (replace with actual release URL)
  wget [GitHub release URL]/docura-1.0.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
  
  # Install
  sudo pacman -U docura-1.0.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst

The Omarchy integration works out of the box—it just detects and syncs.

WHY I'M SHARING THIS

1. You inspired it - Your writing on opinionated software shaped how I built this
2. Omarchy deserves this - Great tools should work together seamlessly
3. Others can learn - Open source example of respectful integration
4. You might actually use it - Built for Omarchy users like you

• GitHub: https://github.com/WOF-Softwares/Docura
• Blog: "Respecting Omakase: Why We Built DHH's Philosophy Into Docura"

The README has a dedicated Omarchy section with theme mappings and a note thanking you for Rails, Basecamp, and Omarchy.

I don't expect a response (I know you're busy). But if you have 5 minutes to test it on your Omarchy setup, I'd love to hear what you think.

Even if you never use it, thank you for:
• Rails - showed us convention over configuration
• Your writing - taught us to have opinions  
• Omarchy - proved Linux can be beautiful and opinionated
• Your example - inspired a generation of developers

This integration exists because you showed us that opinionated software, done right, is liberating.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. The entire integration—detection, font sync, theme mapping, control respect—is ~200 lines of Rust + JavaScript. Simple, opinionated, it just works. Just like you'd build it.
