# Building Docura in 37 Hours

## üí° The Spark

A few nights ago, I opened Typora and was reminded of why I loved it ‚Äî the clean interface, the beautiful typography, the distraction-free writing. But I had 15 days left on my trial, and instead of reaching for my wallet, I asked myself: **"Could I build something better?"**

Not just a clone ‚Äî something that addressed Typora's limitations:
- Only one editing mode (WYSIWYG-only can feel limiting)
- No split-pane view for learning markdown syntax
- Closed source and $14.99 price tag
- Massive disk footprint (326 MB installation!)
- Heavy memory usage (1011 MB on my system)
- Poor Linux integration (no tiling window manager support)

So I fired up my IDE and started what became **Docura**.

## üèóÔ∏è The Tech Stack

I chose **Tauri 2.8** as the foundation for three critical reasons:

1. **No Bundled Chromium**: Tauri uses the system's native WebKit renderer instead of bundling a full Chromium instance like Electron does.
   - **Disk**: 12 MB vs 326 MB (96% smaller!)
   - **RAM**: 780 MB vs 1011 MB (23% lighter)
   - **Download**: 5 MB vs 80 MB (94% smaller)
   
   You could install **27 copies** of Docura in Typora's disk space!

2. **Rust Backend**: File I/O, system integration, and window management in native Rust instead of Node.js means lower overhead and better security.

3. **Native Integration**: On Linux, Tauri apps feel truly native ‚Äî respecting system themes, using system dialogs, and integrating seamlessly with window managers.

For the frontend, I picked:
- **React 19** with Vite 7 for instant HMR
- **Monaco Editor** (the same editor powering VS Code)
- **@uiw/react-md-editor** for WYSIWYG editing
- **react-markdown** + **remark-gfm** for GFM rendering
- **jspdf** + **html2canvas** for PDF generation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Three Editing Modes

The core innovation in Docura is **three distinct editing modes**:

### 1. Code Mode üìù
Pure markdown editing with Monaco Editor featuring custom syntax highlighting for 12 themes, line numbers, code folding, and all IDE features.

### 2. Live Mode ‚úçÔ∏è (The Game-Changer)
Split-pane WYSIWYG editing that solves Typora's biggest weakness:
- Left pane: Raw markdown with toolbar buttons
- Right pane: Live rendered preview
- Educational and powerful

### 3. Preview Mode üëÅÔ∏è
Read-only rendered markdown with Typora-inspired typography, interactive checkboxes, and clickable outline navigation.

## üï∞Ô∏è The Timeline

| Time | Achievement |
|------|-------------|
| **Oct 9, 10:12 PM** | Project started |
| **Overnight** | Tauri + React setup, Monaco integration |
| **Oct 10** | Theme system, WYSIWYG mode, toolbar |
| **Oct 10, late** | File explorer, outline navigation |
| **Oct 11, morning** | PDF export, print preview, native dialogs |
| **Oct 11, 11:29 AM** | ‚úÖ **v1.0 complete** |

**Total: 37 hours and 17 minutes.**

## üìä The Performance Win

Real-world comparison on Arch Linux:

| Metric | Typora | Docura | Savings |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Disk Space** | 326 MB | 12 MB | **96%** ‚ö° |
| **RAM Usage** | 1011 MB | 780 MB | **23%** ‚ö° |
| **Download** | 80 MB | 5 MB | **94%** ‚ö° |
| **Price** | $14.99 | $0.00 | **$14.99** üí∞ |

**The efficiency is staggering.** No bundled Chromium, Rust backend, optimized React rendering, and efficient WebKitGTK combine to make Docura incredibly lightweight without sacrificing any features.

## üéØ What's Next

Docura v1.0 is production-ready, but there's more to build:
- Search & replace (Ctrl+F, Ctrl+H)
- Recent files list
- Diagram support (Mermaid, PlantUML)
- Math equations (LaTeX/KaTeX)
- AppImage & AUR packaging

## üí¨ Final Thoughts

Docura started as a "can I build this?" challenge. 37 hours later, it's a markdown editor that:
- Uses **96% less disk space** than Typora (12 MB vs 326 MB!)
- Uses **23% less RAM** (780 MB vs 1011 MB)
- Has **94% smaller downloads** (5 MB vs 80 MB)
- Offers **three editing modes** instead of one
- Costs **$0** instead of $14.99
- Respects **Linux workflows**
- Is **fully open source**
