# 🚀 Dropbox Cloud Sync is Here! Your Documents, Everywhere

**October 13, 2025** • 12 min read

*How Docura became the first markdown editor with true, secure, app-folder cloud sync - and why this changes everything for writers.*

---

## 🎊 The Big Announcement

**Docura now syncs with Dropbox!** 

Your markdown documents are no longer trapped on one machine. Write on your desktop, continue on your laptop, review on your tablet - all seamlessly synchronized through Dropbox.

**And we did it the RIGHT way.**

## 🔐 Security First: App Folder Architecture

Unlike other editors that ask for **full Dropbox access** (scary!), Docura uses **App Folder access**:

```
Dropbox/
└── Apps/
    └── Docura Sync/    ← Only this folder!
        ├── Work Notes/
        ├── Personal/
        └── Projects/
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ Docura can ONLY access `/Apps/Docura Sync/` folder
- ✅ Cannot see any other files in your Dropbox
- ✅ Clear, visible, organized structure
- ✅ Easy to manage and delete
- ✅ Privacy-first architecture

**Your family photos? Tax documents? Work files?** Docura will never see them. Never.

## ✨ How It Works

### 1. Connect Once
- Click "Connect Dropbox" in Settings → Cloud Sync
- Beautiful OAuth flow (no passwords!)
- Authorize with one click
- Done! ✅

### 2. Choose What to Sync
- Select local folders (e.g., `~/Documents/Notes`)
- Name them in Dropbox (e.g., "My Notes")
- Files auto-sync on save
- That's it!

### 3. Write Anywhere
- Edit on desktop → Saves to Dropbox
- Open laptop → Latest version ready
- Switch devices seamlessly
- Your work follows you

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### The Old Way (Painful):
1. Save file on Desktop
2. Email to yourself
3. Download on Laptop
4. Edit
5. Email back
6. Remember which version is latest
7. Cry when you edit the wrong version 😭

### The Docura Way (Beautiful):
1. Write
2. Auto-saves to Dropbox
3. Done! ✨

**Your documents are always in sync. Always.**

## 🚀 Features That Make It Special

### Auto-Sync on Save
No manual sync button. No "remember to sync." Just write and save:
- **Manual Save (Ctrl+S)** → Syncs to Dropbox
- **Auto-Save** → Syncs to Dropbox
- **Zero thinking required** → Just works

### Smart Folder Mapping
```
Local: ~/Documents/Work/Projects/
    → Dropbox: /Apps/Docura Sync/Work Projects/

Local: ~/Notes/Personal/
    → Dropbox: /Apps/Docura Sync/Personal/
```

Clean, organized, makes sense.

### Multiple Sync Folders
Sync as many folders as you need:
- Work documents
- Personal notes
- Project ideas
- Meeting minutes
- Whatever you want!

### Beautiful UI
- Connection status clearly shown
- Sync folder management built-in
- Add/remove folders with one click
- See exactly what's synced
