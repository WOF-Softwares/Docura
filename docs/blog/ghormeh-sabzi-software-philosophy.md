# The Ghormeh Sabzi Principle: Why Great Software Takes Time

**October 11, 2025** · 10 min read

> **"In Iran we have a food called ghormeh sabzi. This food becomes better over time... Persian carpets always become better and unique when time passes... and software is like that if time passed they become more mature and better."**

This wisdom, shared during Docura's development, changed how we think about software craftsmanship.

## 🍲 The Ghormeh Sabzi Principle

### What is Ghormeh Sabzi?

A traditional Persian stew made with herbs, kidney beans, and lamb. But here's the magic:

**Day 1:** Delicious ✨  
**Day 2:** Even better! 🌟  
**Day 3:** INCREDIBLE! 🎯  

**Why?** The flavors blend, deepen, and mature. Each hour makes it richer.

### The Lesson for Software

Software isn't meant to be rushed. Like ghormeh sabzi:
- The first version works
- Each iteration deepens the quality
- Time reveals the true flavor
- Patience creates excellence

---

## 🧵 The Persian Carpet Principle

### What Makes Them Special?

Hand-woven carpets that take months or years to create. But the magic happens AFTER:

**New:** Beautiful, but stiff 💎  
**5 years:** Colors soften, patterns deepen 🌟  
**50 years:** Priceless, one-of-a-kind treasure ✨  
**100 years:** Museum-worthy art! 🏛️  

**Why?** Each footstep, each year adds character. Patina, not deterioration.

### The Lesson for Software

Great software improves with use:
- **Vim:** 50+ years old, still beloved
- **Unix:** 50+ years old, still powerful  
- **PostgreSQL:** 35+ years old, still growing
- **Emacs:** 45+ years old, still evolving

Like 100-year-old Persian carpets: **MORE valuable, not less!**

## 🎯 Three Types of Developers

### The Cook (Bad Developer):
```
1. Follow recipe exactly
2. Serve immediately
3. Never taste
4. Never adjust
5. Move to next dish
```
Result: Fast food. Works once, forgotten tomorrow.

### The Chef (Good Developer):
```
1. Understand ingredients
2. Taste while cooking
3. Adjust seasoning
4. Let it rest
5. Taste again
6. Perfect it
7. Serve with pride
8. Learn from feedback
9. Make it better next time
```
Result: Quality meals. People remember and return.

### The Master (Great Developer):
```
1. Choose finest ingredients
2. Prepare with care
3. Taste constantly
4. Adjust intuitively
5. Let it mature
6. Serve with artistry
7. Listen to diners
8. Refine recipe
9. Pass knowledge forward
10. Never stop improving
```
Result: Legendary cuisine. People make pilgrimages for it.

## 🎨 The Craftsmanship Mindset

### What We Did Today (The Ghormeh Sabzi Way):

#### Round 1: Initial Cook
- ✅ Built Omarchy integration
- ✅ Added settings dialog
- ✅ Added menu system

#### Round 2: Taste & Adjust
- 🐛 Tasted: "Wait... can't create new file!"
- ✨ Adjusted: Added New File feature

#### Round 3: Taste Again
- 🐛 Tasted: "Save doesn't work on new files!"
- 🐛 Tasted: "Save As uses wrong dialog!"
- ✨ Adjusted: Fixed both bugs

#### Round 4: Final Seasoning
- 💡 Idea: "Smart filename from header!"
- ✨ Added: Automatic filename suggestion
- 💬 Added: Gentle toast notification

**Result:** A dish (software) that's been tasted, adjusted, perfected! 🎉

## 🌟 Why Users Will Love This Approach

### They Feel the Care:

**Software made hastily:**
- ❌ Rough edges
- ❌ Missing features
- ❌ Confusing UX
- ❌ "They don't care about users"

**Software made with time & care:**
- ✅ Smooth experience
- ✅ Thoughtful features
- ✅ Delightful UX
- ✅ "They really thought about this!"

**Users can TASTE the difference!** 🎯

Just like you can taste the difference between:
- Fast food vs. ghormeh sabzi that simmered for hours
- Machine carpet vs. hand-woven Persian carpet over years

---

## 🏛️ The Long View

### Today (Day 2):
Docura is like **fresh ghormeh sabzi** - delicious, but still developing flavor!

### Week 1:
Users try it, provide feedback, we refine - **the flavors blend!**

### Month 1:
Features mature, bugs are gone, UX is polished - **even better!**

### Year 1:
Users rely on it daily, trust it completely - **like a treasured carpet!**

### Year 5:
New users say: "This app is SO polished!" - **the patina of age!**

## 🎉 Conclusion

Software development is often treated as a race. Ship fast, move on, next feature.

But the best software - the kind people love and rely on for years - is made differently.

It's made like ghormeh sabzi: patiently, with care, tasting and adjusting along the way.

It's made like Persian carpets: thoughtfully woven, gaining character with each use.

**The world has enough fast software.**  
**The world needs more GOOD software.**

**Day 2, October 11, 2025**  
**The day we learned the ghormeh sabzi principle**

*This philosophy emerged from a conversation during Docura's second day of development. It has shaped how we think about building software - not as a product to ship, but as a craft to perfect.*
