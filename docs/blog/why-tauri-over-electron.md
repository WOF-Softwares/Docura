# Why Tauri is Perfect for Markdown Editors

When I started building Docura, the first decision was the framework. **Electron** is the obvious choice — it powers VSCode, Obsidian, and many other successful apps. But I chose **Tauri** instead. Here's why.

## 🚀 Memory Efficiency

The numbers speak for themselves:

- **Electron apps** bundle an entire Chromium browser (~150 MB) plus Node.js runtime
- **Tauri apps** use the system's WebKit renderer (0 MB bundled)

For Docura:
- Electron version (theoretical): ~1200 MB
- Tauri version (actual): **780 MB**
- **Savings: ~420 MB (35%)**

When you're working with documents, every MB counts. Why waste memory on a bundled browser when the OS already has one?

## 🔒 Security by Design

Tauri's architecture is fundamentally more secure:

1. **Rust backend** - Memory-safe by design, no buffer overflows
2. **IPC boundary** - Frontend and backend are strictly separated
3. **Explicit permissions** - Must declare file system, dialog, and network access
4. **No Node.js in frontend** - Frontend can't access system APIs directly

With Electron, a single XSS vulnerability can compromise the entire system. With Tauri, the blast radius is contained.

## 🐧 True Native Integration

On Linux (my primary platform), Tauri feels native because it **is** native:

- Uses **system dialogs** (not Chrome's file picker)
- Respects **system themes** automatically
- Integrates with **window managers** (I auto-detect tiling WMs!)
- Binary is **truly compiled** (not JavaScript in a zip file)

Compare this to Electron apps that feel like web apps in a window. They work, but they don't feel like part of the system.

## ⚡ Startup Performance

Cold start times:

- **Electron**: 800ms - 1.5s (loading Chromium + Node)
- **Tauri**: 200ms - 400ms (native binary + system WebKit)

For a document editor that you open dozens of times per day, this adds up to minutes saved.

## 📦 Distribution Size

Binary sizes for a minimal app:

- **Electron**: ~120 MB (Windows), ~150 MB (Linux)
- **Tauri**: ~6 MB (Windows), ~8 MB (Linux with WebKitGTK)

Smaller binaries mean:
- Faster downloads
- Less disk space
- Easier package distribution
- Lower bandwidth costs

## 🎯 The Trade-offs

Tauri isn't perfect. The trade-offs:

### What You Lose:
- **Cross-platform rendering** - WebKit vs Chromium differences
- **Mature ecosystem** - Fewer community packages
- **Node.js in frontend** - Can't use Node APIs directly

### What You Gain:
- **Performance** - 2-3x lower memory, faster startup
- **Security** - Rust safety + isolated frontend
- **Size** - 95% smaller binaries
- **Native feel** - True OS integration

## 💡 When to Use Tauri

Use Tauri when you need:
- ✅ Native file system access
- ✅ Low memory footprint
- ✅ Fast startup times
- ✅ Security by default
- ✅ Native OS integration

Use Electron when you need:
- ✅ Exact cross-platform rendering
- ✅ Mature Node.js ecosystem
- ✅ Legacy Node.js packages
- ✅ Larger team familiar with Electron

## 🔮 The Future

Tauri 2.0 (which Docura uses) brings:
- Mobile support (iOS/Android)
- Better plugin system
- Enhanced IPC performance
- Improved developer experience

For document-focused apps like Docura, Tauri is the clear winner. The performance gains are real, the security is better, and the native integration makes Linux users (like me) very happy.
