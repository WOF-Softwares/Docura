# 🎯 Focus Mode & ⌨️ Typewriter Mode User Guide

> **Typora-style distraction-free writing, now in Docura!**

## 🎉 Welcome to Enhanced Writing Modes

Docura now includes two powerful writing modes inspired by Typora, designed to help you achieve **flow state** and write with maximum focus.

---

## 🎯 Focus Mode (F8)

### What is Focus Mode?

Focus Mode helps you concentrate on **one paragraph at a time** by dimming all other content. This reduces visual clutter and helps maintain focus on your current thought.

### How It Works

```
Normal Mode:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ # My Document                   │ ← Fully visible
│                                 │
│ This is paragraph one with      │ ← Fully visible
│ some text about something.      │
│                                 │
│ This is paragraph two with      │ ← Fully visible
│ more interesting content.       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

Focus Mode (cursor in paragraph one):
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ # My Document                   │ ← Dimmed (30% opacity)
│                                 │
│ This is paragraph one with      │ ← Bright (100% opacity) ✨
│ some text about something.      │
│                                 │
│ This is paragraph two with      │ ← Dimmed (30% opacity)
│ more interesting content.       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## ⌨️ Typewriter Mode (F9)

### What is Typewriter Mode?

Typewriter Mode keeps your cursor **centered vertically** on the screen, creating a comfortable writing position that reduces eye strain and helps maintain focus.

### How It Works

```
Normal Mode (cursor scrolls up):
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Line 1                          │
│ Line 2                          │
│ Line 3 (cursor here) ◀─────┐    │
│ Line 4                      │    │
│ Line 5                      │    │
│ ...                         │    │
│ Line 20                     │    │
│ Line 21                     │    │
└─────────────────────────────┘    │
                               Cursor moves up
                               
Typewriter Mode (cursor stays centered):
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ (scroll space - 50vh padding)   │
│ ...                             │
│ Line 1                          │
│ Line 2                          │
│ Line 3 (cursor here) ◀─── Always centered
│ Line 4                          │
│ Line 5                          │
│ ...                             │

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Focus Mode Not Working?

**Check:**
1. ✅ Are you in Live mode? (Not Code or Preview)
2. ✅ Is Modern editor selected? (Settings → Live Editor Type)
3. ✅ Is the toolbar button active? (accent color background)
4. ✅ Try toggling off and on again (F8 twice)

### Typewriter Mode Not Centering?

**Check:**
1. ✅ Are you in Live mode?
2. ✅ Is there enough content? (needs multiple paragraphs)
3. ✅ Is the window tall enough? (typewriter needs vertical space)
4. ✅ Try toggling off and on again (F9 twice)

### Both Modes Seem Slow?

**Fix:**
1. Close other applications (free up memory)
2. Disable one mode if needed
3. Check if auto-save is running (status bar)
4. Reduce window size for better performance
