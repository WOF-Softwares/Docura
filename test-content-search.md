This is a test file to demonstrate the enhanced **content search** functionality in Docura's Quick Search (Ctrl+P).

## Features to Test

### Filename Matching
- Search for "test" - should match this filename first
- Search for "content" - should find this file by filename

### Heading Search
- Search for "Features" - should find the "Features to Test" heading
- Search for "Heading Search" - should match this exact heading

### Content Matching
Here's some content with the word **perfect** that should be found when searching.

The search should also find this **amazing** functionality and show a preview.

## Deep Content

This section contains some **hidden gems** that the search should discover:

- Advanced search capabilities
- Content preview functionality  
- Intelligent ranking system
- Multi-level search (filename > headings > content)

### Technical Details

The search algorithm prioritizes results in this order:
1. **Filename matches** (highest priority)
2. **Heading matches** (medium-high priority)
3. **Content matches** (medium priority)

Search for "algorithm" and this paragraph should appear in results!

## Conclusion

This enhanced search makes Docura even more **powerful** than traditional editors.
