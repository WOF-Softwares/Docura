3. Claude AI: "Here's the implementation" (5 minutes)
4. Development: Component + styling + logic (20 minutes)
5. Testing: Works perfectly! (3 minutes)

**Total: 30 minutes** ⚡

**Typora (hypothetical):**
1. User: "Please ask before opening window" (Day 1)
2. PM: "Let's discuss in next planning" (Week 1)
3. Team Meeting: "Should we do this?" (Week 2)
4. Design: "Let me mock this up" (Week 3)
5. Design Review: "Change colors" (Week 4)
6. Sprint Planning: "Add to backlog" (Week 5)
7. Development: "I'll pick this up" (Week 8)
8. Code Review: "Needs changes" (Week 9)
9. QA: "Found issues" (Week 10)
10. Release: "In next version" (Month 6)

**Total: Maybe 6 months?** 🐌

## 💎 Why This Matters

### **1. Speed = Competitive Advantage**

**Market Reality:**
- Typora releases: Once every few months
- Docura releases: Can ship daily if needed!

**User Impact:**

### **2. No Bureaucracy = User-Centric**

**Traditional Team:**
```
User Request → Filters through:
- Product priorities

- Budget concerns
- Timeline constraints

Result: User needs get diluted
```

**Solo + AI:**
```
User Request → Direct implementation

Result: Pure user-centric development
```

---

### **3. Direct Feedback Loop**

**Docura Process:**
1. User reports issue
2. Developer understands
3. AI helps implement
4. User tests
5. Iterate if needed

**Total cycle: Minutes to hours!** ⚡

**Traditional Process:**
1. User reports issue
2. Support tickets
3. PM reviews
4. Team prioritizes
5. Design reviews
6. Development waits
7. Weeks/months later...

**Total cycle: Weeks to months!** 🐌
